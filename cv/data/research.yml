    My educational research interests focus on inequality in
    participation and attainment of pupils in the English school system. 
    I have also carried out research on teacher recruitment, retention, and performance. 
    From a sociological perspective, my research has centred around social class,
    race, ethnicity, and migration. I am also interested in research methods.
