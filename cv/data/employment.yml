    description: I worked as a quantitative researcher to provide data management, analysis and research skills to this educational research and data company. I asked and answered pressing education policy questions using large national and international datasets, both specific to education and others (e.g. election data, local government data, census data). I also taught research, data and statistical skills to teachers and leaders, and presented research findings at conferences. Many of my research findings are publicly available through reports, academic articles, and blog posts.
